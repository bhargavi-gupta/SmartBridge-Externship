# Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder:Classification
The project aims to develop a machine learning model for the detection of Autism Spectrum 
Disorder (ASD). Complex neurodevelopmental illness known as autism is characterised by 
issues with speech, social interaction, and repetitive behaviours. Early ASD discovery is 
essential for prompt intervention and improved outcomes for those living with the illness. 
To achieve this goal, the project leverages an existing dataset that encompasses a range of 
pertinent information, including behavioural observations, survey responses, and 
demographic data. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and testing the 
machine learning algorithms employed in the project. By analyzing this dataset, the 
algorithms can uncover underlying patterns and trends that can aid in the identification of 
ASD cases
